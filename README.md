You're right, I need to actually apply the changes to the README file. Let me update it now.

Read file: README.md
I can see the current README still has all the charts and React mentions. Let me create a completely new version with only the Component Interaction Flow chart and no React mentions:

# Digital Consent Management System

A comprehensive digital consent management system that demonstrates secure, transparent, and user-controlled data sharing between financial services and users through Solid Pods and blockchain logging.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

The system implements a modern consent management architecture with four core components working together to provide secure, auditable, and user-controlled data sharing:

**User Layer**: End users interact with the system through web browsers, accessing the frontend application interface.

**Frontend Layer**: The frontend application (Consent Bank Connect) provides the main user interface, including authentication modals, consent waiting screens, and Solid Pod interfaces for data management.

**Backend Services**: A Flask API server handles logging services, authentication, and blockchain integration through dedicated services.

**External Services**: Solid Pods serve as personal data stores, while Multichain provides the blockchain network for immutable logging.

The system flow connects users through browsers to the frontend app, which communicates with backend services for authentication and logging, while integrating with external Solid Pod storage and blockchain networks.

## üéØ Digital Consent Framework Components

### Framework Overview

The framework consists of four main layers:

**Third-Party Applications**: Financial institutions like banks, insurance companies, and healthcare providers that request user data access. These applications initiate data requests and receive consent results directly from user Solid Pods.

**ConsentFlow Intermediate Layer**: A routing and authentication system that manages requests between third-party apps and user Solid Pods. It includes authentication management, consent validation, and event logging for all consent activities.

**Solid Pod Ecosystem**: User-controlled personal data containers that store encrypted user data and provide consent management interfaces. Users can select specific data fields and grant or revoke permissions through dedicated consent applications.

**Blockchain Audit Layer**: A Multichain blockchain network that provides immutable consent logs and GDPR compliance records, creating a complete audit trail for regulatory compliance.

All components connect to the blockchain audit layer, ensuring every consent-related action is logged for compliance and transparency.

```

## üè¶ Third-Party Application (Bank App Example)

### Bank Application Architecture

The SecureBank application consists of several interconnected components:

**User Interface**: Provides service selection and account management capabilities through an intuitive web interface.

**Authentication System**: Handles user login, session management, and secure credential verification.

**API Client**: Manages data requests and service integration with external systems and user Solid Pods.

**Local Storage**: Stores user preferences and session data for improved user experience.

**Banking Services**: Core financial services including account management and transaction processing.

**Investment Services**: Portfolio management and trading capabilities for investment products.

**Credit Services**: Loan processing and credit card management services.

The application flow connects the user interface to authentication and API services, which then integrate with various banking, investment, and credit services.

### Bank App Data Request Flow

The data request process follows a systematic approach:

1. User selects a banking service from the application interface
2. Bank app requests necessary user data for service provision
3. System checks if required data is available locally
4. If data exists locally, it uses cached information
5. If data is not available, the app requests access from user's Solid Pod
6. User is redirected to ConsentFlow for authentication
7. After successful authentication, consent interface is displayed
8. User grants consent for specific data fields
9. Data is securely shared with the bank application
10. Bank provides the requested service using the shared data

## üîÑ ConsentFlow Intermediate Application

### ConsentFlow Router Architecture

The ConsentFlow router serves as the central coordination system with several key components:

**Request Handler**: Receives and validates data requests from third-party applications, ensuring proper format and authentication.

**Authentication Service**: Manages user verification and session management for secure access control.

**Consent Manager**: Handles consent flows and validates permissions against existing user preferences.

**Router**: Directs requests to appropriate Solid Pods based on user identity and service requirements.

**Logger**: Records all consent activities for GDPR compliance and audit purposes.

**External Integrations**: Connects with third-party apps, user Solid Pods, and blockchain networks for comprehensive data flow management.

The router processes requests through authentication, consent validation, and routing stages before logging activities to the blockchain.

### ConsentFlow Routing Logic

The routing process follows a comprehensive decision tree:

1. Third-party app submits a data request
2. System validates the request format and parameters
3. If request is invalid, an error is returned
4. If valid, user authentication is performed
5. If authentication fails, user is redirected to login
6. If authenticated, system checks for existing consent
7. If consent exists, scope is validated against current request
8. If scope is sufficient, access is granted
9. If no consent exists or scope is insufficient, user is routed to Solid Pod
10. User manages consent through Solid Pod interface
11. Consent decision is logged to blockchain
12. Result is returned to requesting application

## üóÑÔ∏è Solid Pod - Personal Data Container

### Solid Pod Architecture

The Solid Pod container provides a comprehensive personal data management system:

**Pod Application**: Main interface for consent management and data visualization, allowing users to control their personal information.

**Data Manager**: Handles CRUD operations and data validation for all stored information.

**Consent Interface**: Manages permission settings and data field selection for third-party access.

**Security Layer**: Provides encryption and access control for all stored data.

**Data Storage Categories**:
- Basic Information: Name, email, phone number
- Contact Details: Address and emergency contact information
- Personal Data: Date of birth, marital status
- Professional Information: Job position, employer, income
- Financial Data: Bank accounts, credit history

**Consent Management**:
- Active Consents: Current permissions granted to third parties
- Consent History: Complete record of past consent decisions
- Revocation Log: Track of withdrawn permissions

The pod application connects to data management and security layers, which protect various categories of personal information while maintaining comprehensive consent records.

### Solid Pod Consent Management Flow

The consent management process follows a user-centric approach:

1. Consent request is received from third-party application
2. System displays available data categories to user
3. User selects specific data fields for sharing
4. User sets permission levels and access duration
5. System validates that required fields are selected
6. If required fields are missing, error message is shown
7. If validation passes, consent record is created
8. Selected data is encrypted for secure sharing
9. Encrypted data is sent to requesting application
10. Consent decision is logged for audit purposes
11. Consent history is updated with new record

## ‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain - GDPR Compliance Audit Trail

### Blockchain Architecture for Consent Logging

The Multichain network provides a robust foundation for consent logging:

**Network Nodes**: Distributed validation system with consensus mechanisms ensuring data integrity across the network.

**Data Streams**: Dedicated channels for consent events and audit records, organized by event type and compliance requirements.

**Digital Wallets**: User identity management and transaction signing for secure blockchain interactions.

**Consent Event Types**:
- Data Request Events: Third-party application requests for user data
- Consent Granted Events: User permissions given to specific applications
- Consent Denied Events: User rejections of data access requests
- Consent Revoked Events: Withdrawal of previously granted permissions
- Data Access Events: Actual usage of shared data by third parties

**GDPR Compliance Features**:
- Legal Basis Tracking: Article 6 compliance verification
- Purpose Limitation: Specific use case validation
- Data Minimization: Minimal data sharing enforcement
- Retention Periods: Data lifecycle management
- Right to be Forgotten: Data deletion request handling

The blockchain processes events through validation nodes, stores them in immutable blocks, and maintains comprehensive GDPR compliance records.

### Blockchain Event Schema

Each consent event is recorded with comprehensive metadata:

```json
{
  "eventId": "consent_2024_001",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "eventType": "consent_granted",
  "user": {
    "userId": "user_12345",
    "pseudonym": "anon_abc123"
  },
  "thirdParty": {
    "appId": "securebank_001",
    "appName": "SecureBank",
    "serviceType": "personal_banking"
  },
  "consent": {
    "dataFields": ["name", "email", "phone"],
    "purpose": "Account creation and verification",
    "legalBasis": "GDPR_Article_6_1a",
    "retentionPeriod": "7_years",

    "purposeLimitation": true,
    "storageLimitation": true,
    "rightToWithdraw": true
  },
  "blockchain": {
    "transactionId": "tx_abc123def456",
    "blockHash": "0x1234567890abcdef",
    "blockNumber": 12345,
    "gasUsed": 21000
  }
}
```

### GDPR Compliance Tracking

The compliance tracking process ensures regulatory adherence:

1. Consent event occurs in the system
2. GDPR requirements are validated against the event
3. If requirements are not met, compliance issue is flagged
4. If compliant, blockchain record is created
5. Legal basis is included in the record
6. Retention period is set according to data type
7. Purpose limitation is recorded
8. Withdrawal mechanism is enabled
9. Immutable record is stored in blockchain
10. Audit trail is generated for regulatory reporting

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Blockchain Consent Logging System

### Comprehensive Logging Architecture

The logging system integrates multiple data sources and processing layers:

**Data Sources**:
- Third-Party Applications: Banks, insurance companies, healthcare providers initiating data access requests
- Solid Pods: User consent decisions and data field selections from personal data stores
- ConsentFlow Router: Authentication events and routing decisions from the intermediate layer

**Blockchain Network**:
- Validator Nodes: Consensus validation and data integrity checks across the network
- Stream Manager: Consent event streams and GDPR compliance log management
- Storage Layer: Immutable blockchain blocks and audit trail records

**GDPR as Regulation**:
- Legal Basis Tracker: Article 6 compliance and consent validation
- Purpose Limitation: Specific use case validation and scope verification
- Data Minimization: Minimal data sharing enforcement and field validation
- Retention Manager: Data lifecycle management and deletion scheduling
- Withdrawal Tracker: Consent revocation and right to withdraw implementation

Data flows from sources through validator nodes to stream management and storage layers, with comprehensive GDPR compliance processing at each stage.

### Real-Time Logging Flow

The real-time logging process ensures immediate compliance tracking:

1. Third-party app logs data request event to blockchain
2. System validates GDPR compliance requirements
3. Audit trail is updated with new request record
4. Solid Pod logs user consent decision
5. Immutable record is stored in blockchain
6. Compliance reports are updated with new consent
7. ConsentFlow logs authentication event
8. User identity is validated and access logs updated
9. Third-party app logs actual data access event
10. Consent scope is verified against usage
11. Usage reports are updated with access details
12. Solid Pod logs consent withdrawal if requested
13. Consent status is updated in blockchain
14. Withdrawal logs are updated for audit purposes

This creates a complete GDPR-compliant audit trail covering all consent-related activities.

### GDPR Article Compliance Mapping

The system maps directly to GDPR requirements:

- **Article 6(1)(a)**: Explicit consent recorded with legal basis tracking
- **Article 7**: Conditions for consent met through explicit consent validation
- **Article 5(1)(a)**: Lawful, fair, transparent processing through data minimization
- **Article 5(1)(b)**: Purpose limitation enforced through scope validation
- **Article 5(1)(c)**: Data minimization through field selection requirements
- **Article 5(1)(d)**: Accuracy maintained through validation processes
- **Article 5(1)(e)**: Storage limitation through retention period management
- **Article 5(1)(f)**: Integrity and confidentiality through encryption
- **Article 15**: Right of access through data portability features
- **Article 16**: Right to rectification through data modification capabilities
- **Article 17**: Right to erasure through deletion mechanisms
- **Article 20**: Right to data portability through export features
- **Article 21**: Right to object through withdrawal mechanisms
- **Article 30**: Records of processing activities through audit trail

### Blockchain Log Categories

The system categorizes all logged events for comprehensive tracking:

**Consent Events**: Data requests from third parties, consent granted by users, consent denied, and consent revoked events.

**Data Processing**: Actual data access, modifications, deletions, and export requests for data portability.

**System Events**: Authentication activities, authorization checks, request routing, and validation processes.

**Compliance Events**: Audit checks, regulatory report generation, breach notifications, and data protection officer contacts.

All event categories are logged to the blockchain for immutable audit trails and regulatory compliance.
